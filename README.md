# SharpMIDI

## Version 3 Prerelease

This version is in public Beta and is currently missing a lot of features.

This program finally uses Windows Forms! Because of this you might come across crashes and bugs.

You can now load archive files with SharpMIDI although it goes a lot slower.

Please report any bugs you find!
