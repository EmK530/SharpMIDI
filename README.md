# SharpMIDI

SharpMIDI is a console based MIDI player optimized to load huge MIDI files.

## Quick info

This is a project I've mainly done to try my hands on C# and become better at it, therefore you might find some parts of code that aren't quite so good. But I'd love to learn! Let me know about any issues!

## Requirements

MIDI files, of course.

And if you are seeking performance then please download the synth [OmniMIDI](https://github.com/KeppySoftware/OmniMIDI/releases).

## Build Info

This was programmed with .NET 6.0.

If you find that building does not work with the included batch file after downloading the SDK then you can try downloading the same version that this application was programmed with, 6.0.400.

If issues still persist, create an issue so I can look deeper as I am not sure if I uploaded everything required for building.
